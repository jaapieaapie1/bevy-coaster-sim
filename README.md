# Bevy coaster sim
VERY MUCH NOT FINISHED. And probably will never be production ready.

This is a hobby project where I am creating a roller coaster simulation inside of the Bevy game engine.  
However, the end goal of this was never and will never be a roller coaster game.
It is supposed to be a headless service which will comunicate the state of the roller coasters to other applications like Minecraft servers.
It will most likely only get a very simple 3d view for debugging/development purposes which will not be available in production, since this would ideally be running inside a docker container on a server.
